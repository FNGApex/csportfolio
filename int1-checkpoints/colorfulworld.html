        I have many topics of interest, but my 2 favorites are Video Games and Swimmming.
    </h1>

        <h3>
            Lets start with the more important one of the two, swimming.
        </h3>

            I like simming because it helps me stay fit and gives me energy during the day.<br> I swim for SLST (Saint Lawrence Swim Team)

            I like swimming because it makes me look fit and helps me become stronger and more indurant to cold weather. Swimming takes the most stamina out of all sports that is why i love it the most.<br>Most people can run a mile in under 10 mins but few could even swimm a mile without fully draining out, this sets me appart from the average fit pesron by making me not only fit on land like others but making me look great in both the water and land.

        <h3>
            Now lets switch to the 2nd topic which is Video Games
        </h3>
        <p class="btext">
            My Most Favorite Game of all time in which I have over 4000 hours time on playtime is <a href="https://minecraft.net/" >Minecraft</a>.<br> Now why minecraft there are so many great games and you chooose minecraft people might say? I say that because it was the game I grew up to being a person who had a PC able to run it by the age 4. This game raised me up every update I knew untill version 1.6 I was all into the game. Then I started to move houses and mature.<br> My current most favorite game which I have clocked 700hrs in the past year is <a href="https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/home/">Rainbow 6 Siege</a> A tactical shooter made by Ubisoft. This game was introduced to me by Mark Haiko and Soren Ryan Jensen and became the first shooter I was to ever play. My 2nd Favorite game is a Game by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers/">Keen Software House</a> called Space Engineers. <br> It is a game with a great physics engine that provides the foundation to build ships and fight drill mine on planets in space on more planets but most importantly mod the game and WRTIE CODE in game to get an upper hand on others.

            Honarable Mentions
        </h2>
        <p class="btext">
            Theese are games which had/have potential but are now not suited for play. <br> <a href="https://survivetheark.com/">Ark Survival Evolved</a>, this game is still great in my opinion but ive played 1200+ hours of it and I also now do not have the graphics card to play this game. <br> The next Game is <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/">Rust</a> which had me for over 1200 hours Just like ARK over 4 years. This game was a great game in its legacy state then it updated and I really never liked it.
