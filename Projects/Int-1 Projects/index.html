                   I like swimming because it keeps me fit and also gives me energy. i swim for the slst swim club and practice 1 a day, 12 hours a week. I have 3 coaches; Coach Barbora, Head coach; Coach Ryan, Assistant; and Coach Noah, Race Preperation Coach. During the week we mainly have coach Barbora and I little bit of Coach Ryan. On saturday I have Coach Noah. On weekdays I swim from 5:30 to 7:30PM. On saturday I swim from 10:00 to 12:00.AM. I prefer swimming over any ohter sport because it works with all 3 key aspecs of you body Balance, Strength and Flexibily. It also helps you with cardio and makes you look great in the water. Unlike other sports swimming is very safe and rarely would you get injured from it. The most serouis of an any injuries ive seen was a sprain ankle by a swimmer who was not paying attention to his surounding and ran into the wall

                    I like gaming because it keeps my mind of off other things and helps me waste time. Gaming is something that takes loads of time away from me but I try to play games that do not reuiqre me to stay attached to them for more than a day. Some of the games I play are Space Engineers people and Rainbow 6 Seige. Space Engineers is a game about the world in 2077 where we are in another solar system almost identical to ours with 4 planets: Earth, Mars, Alien Like Planet(Saturn) and Titan which a moon of jupiter represented as a planet; and of course Our moon. You would build ships, hovercraft, and rovers to traverse planets, space , asteroids , moons, and best of all. Enemy ships. Rainbow Six Siege on the other hand is a round based 5v5 tactical shooter game that sets 5 players to fight against each other in a simulated enviorment or map. There is 32 total heros or operators the player can choose while there are 2 types of rounds an attack and defence. If you are on defence your enemy is on attack. There are 16 operators per side. You cannot play the same operator as a teammate except for recruit who has no specia abilities and no attachments to weapons.

                    I also love to program. I have very depth experience in python and some experience in JS. I can accept myself as a semi-rookie in HTML and CSS. I can solve problems with python and I have a class on programing every sunday where I would go over problems and solve them with code. I know Java Script basics and some Phaser usage. My end goal is to learn Unity and Assembly csharp with C++ or just C so I could start to develop game applications for Computers.
